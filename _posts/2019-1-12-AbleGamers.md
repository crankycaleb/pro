I recently started streaming games on Mixer as a hobby. It's a fun way to meet people with similar interests, and even organize multiplayer games. I don't accept donations for doing things that I enjoy, but wanted to give an avenue for people that still have a desire to give to something that is dear to me. AbleGamers is such an organization.

Come chat sometime, even if you aren't necessarily interested in gaming. If you want to know more about what AbleGamers does, you can checkout their site at [https://ablegamers.org/](https://ablegamers.org/).
