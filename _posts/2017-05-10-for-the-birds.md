subtitle: Not so technical happenings from our front door wreath

Not what I had in mind for the first post I make on what is intended to be a mostly "boring to common folk" technical blog, but the opportunity presented itself to hit the ground running with lightheartedness. It'll also give me an opportunity to brush up on Jekyll and Markdown syntax. We had a bird family make themselves a home in our front door wreath. Needless to say our front door is off limits for opening right now, but we mostly go in and out the garage anyway. Birds grow fast!

Warning: Gratuitous imagery of bird feces ahead.

Doesn't look like it'll be much longer before the flight school of hard knocks begins!
