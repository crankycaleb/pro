Personally, one of the scariest parts of self-hosting is having all my data under one roof. Power issues, theft, fire or other natural disasters are just a few of the potential risks to my data. Luckily, the open source project Duplicati https://www.duplicati.com/ has proven to be a reliable option. Open Source, AES 256 encryption, and a wide variety of backup destinations supporting anywhere from Webdav, S3, to OneDrive, Mega, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others. This solution has given me offsite backups that are encrypted, while also leveraging the proprietary storage provider space I've accumulated (Samsung 100GB OneDrive storage for two years promos, etc) with no cost and minimal risk of data snooping.

This post is by no means intended to be a detailed Duplicati informative guide, as their website already provides plenty of documentation. I'm documenting my own experience that myself or others can use as a "Getting Started" reference to build the basics of a functioning backup solution in Fedora 28 with emailed logs. Let's begin.

**Duplicati Setup**

BlahBlah Fedora start here wget the rpm etc:

`sudo dnf install mono-core libappindicator libappindicator-sharp desktop-file-utils`
`wget https://updates.duplicati.com/beta/duplicati-2.0.3.3-2.0.3.3_beta_20180402.noarch.rpm`
`sudo rpm -ivh duplicati*`
`sudo duplicati-server --webservice-interface=any`
`sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8200/tcp`
`sudo firewall-cmd --reload`
leave running in term go to web interface, set password, then go back to term ctrl-c
`sudo cert-sync /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duplicati/duplicati/master/Installer/debian/debian/duplicati.service`
`sudo mv duplicati.service /etc/systemd/system`
`sudo systemctl enable duplicati`
`sudo systemctl start duplicati`



Then run:

`sudo blah`

Blah blah blah
