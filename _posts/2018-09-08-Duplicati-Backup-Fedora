Personally, one of the scariest parts of self-hosting is having all my data under one roof. Power issues, theft, fire or other natural disasters are just a few of the potential risks to my data. Luckily, the open source project Duplicati (https://www.duplicati.com/) has proven to be a reliable option. Open Source, AES 256 encryption, and a wide variety of backup destinations supporting anywhere from Webdav, S3, to OneDrive, Mega, Google Drive, Dropbox, and others. This solution has given me offsite backups that are encrypted, while also leveraging the proprietary storage provider space I've accumulated (Samsung 100GB OneDrive storage for two years promos, etc) with no cost and minimal risk of data snooping.

This post is by no means intended to be a detailed Duplicati informative guide, as their website already provides plenty of documentation. I'm documenting my own experience that myself or others can use as a "Getting Started" gritty reference to build the basics of a functioning backup solution in Fedora 28 with emailed logs. Let's begin.

**Duplicati 2 Setup**

Install the prerequisites:

`sudo dnf install mono-core libappindicator libappindicator-sharp desktop-file-utils`

Grab the latest rpm (check their site from a web browser first):

`wget https://updates.duplicati.com/beta/duplicati-2.0.3.3-2.0.3.3_beta_20180402.noarch.rpm`

Install the rpm:

`sudo rpm -ivh duplicati*`

Poke holes in firewalld to allow access to the web management frontend:

`sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8200/tcp`
`sudo firewall-cmd --reload`

Start Duplicati and tell it to listen on interfaces other than localhost:

`sudo duplicati-server --webservice-interface=any`

Leave running in terminal, go to the web interface from another pc (http://serverip:8200), set a password, then go back to terminal and ctrl-c.

To work with many third party services, you're going to need to run a cert-sync after setup:

`sudo cert-sync /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

By default, Duplicati expects a graphical desktop and is started by a tray object. I'm running a headless nextcloud instance in this example, so I need to be able to run this as a service instead. Let's grab a service config:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duplicati/duplicati/master/Installer/debian/debian/duplicati.service`

Move it:

`sudo mv duplicati.service /etc/systemd/system`

Then enable at startup and start the service:

`sudo systemctl enable duplicati`
`sudo systemctl start duplicati`

Now to move to configuring for our needs via the web interface.

**Configuring a Backup Job**

There are a few things assumed in this post. First, that you are doing this on your home (trusted) network. Duplicati runs a web service on port 8200 with no native ssl support. Perhaps you can implement ssl support with some work, but it wasn't immediately apparent and not the point of this document. You only need the web service for configuration changes (or not at all if you want to learn the cli syntax for Duplicati - at this time I do not as it can get a bit involved depending on the storage provider you backup to). You could very well just remove the firewall rule and block port 8200 again once you're finished. Just note that the password you set could possibly be sniffed by another device on your home network.

Secondly, it is assumed that you are *only* forwarding the necessary ports from your router for nextcloud services (in this case). So long as you aren't forwarding tcp 8200 then the outside world won't be able to access the management interface.

The web frontend is fairly self explanatory (and mobile friendly!) as shown in some of their own screenshots:

There are too many backup destination provider options to cover here, so I recommend you check their site for documentation on the one(s) you plan to use. The backup job setup process is simple so I'm going to provide the email notification flags you'll want to add to cover all of your backup jobs.

Go to "Settings"
