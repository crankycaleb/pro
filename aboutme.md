My name is Caleb. A few brief points about me:

- A Network Engineer with about 20 years in K12 experience
- Just another jack of all trades geek, but one that's been given amazing opportunities to do it for a living
- Currently tinker with servers and web design in my free time
- Casual gamer, primarily Nintendo, Xbox, and PC  


### About this blog

This is just my little corner of the internet. I'll use it mostly to document how-to's and things I've come 
across in my line of work. Hopefully it can be of use to others at some point.
